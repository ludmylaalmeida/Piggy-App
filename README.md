# Piggy-App

<h3> 1. Project Overview </h3>
Piggy is a social media app for investors that will allow users to create a profile where they can interact with other investors, manage their stocks and bitcoins. They will also be able to create groups to talk about investment opportunities, ask for advice, and learn something new. 
<h3> 2. Goal </h3>
The initial goal was to create a place where people can manage all their portfolios. But since connecting the app to companies like Robinhood, Ameritrade, and Coinbase is unrealistic for the project’s deadline, I decided to leave that feature for a future stage of the app. So the first version would be a social media for investors to interact and create groups to talk about specific investments.
<h3> 3. Problem </h3>
There is currently a lack of a specific platform where users can manage their portfolios and share investment knowledge.
<h3> 4. Market Research and Competition </h3>
The market research showed that there aren’t any competitors providing the type of social interaction proposed by Piggy. 
<h3> 5. Software </h3>
Piggy will be developed for iOS using XCode 11 and coding in Swift 5 and Firebase as a backend. The first step will be prototyping the app using Sketch to create high-fidelity wireframes. For the UI design standards, we will be using SwiftUI and the Human Interface Guidelines provided by Apple. The project will be managed using GitHub issues features.
<h3> 6. Hardware </h3
To develop iOS apps using the latest technologies a Macbook will be used for development and an iPhone 12 will be used for auxiliary testing.
<h3> 7. Design </h3>
